# LiFi Simulation System

A comprehensive simulation system for Light Fidelity (LiFi) communication, focusing on angle-dependent transmission characteristics.

## Overview

This project simulates a LiFi communication system where data is transmitted using LED light and received by a photodetector. The simulation accurately models:

- Angular dependency of signal strength (0째 to 180째)
- Distance-based signal attenuation
- Realistic LED beam patterns
- Environmental interference factors
- Bit-level encoding and transmission protocols

The simulation is designed to mirror a real-world Arduino-based LiFi implementation, allowing for virtual testing of various configurations without requiring physical hardware setup.

## Features

- Angle-based transmission testing (0째 to 180째)
- Distance-based signal attenuation analysis
- Configurable environmental parameters (noise, interference)
- Accurate timing simulation for transmission and reception
- Detailed performance metrics (BER, accuracy)
- CSV data export for further analysis

## Structure
